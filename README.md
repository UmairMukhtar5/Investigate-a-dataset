# Investigate a dataset
For this project, the dataset that I selected was about +100k medical appointments in Brazil that shows whether a patient showed up to his/her appointment or not, as well as multiple other factors that may affect their showing up. I then performed an investigation to answer the question of whether or not there were any characteristics made patients more likely to show up for their appointments.
